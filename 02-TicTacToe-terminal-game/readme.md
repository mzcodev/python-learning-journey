# Tic Tac Toe - Terminal Game

This is a simple text-based Tic Tac Toe game built in Python. The game allows the user to play against another player or against a computer bot. It runs in the terminal and provides clear instructions, visual layout of the board, and interactive gameplay. The goal is to get three of your marks (X or O) in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally — before your opponent does.

## Concepts Used

This project was built using only the following Python concepts learned from the introductory to advanced sections of the course:

- Introduction and setup of Python and development environments
- Data types and variables (numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)
- String operations and formatting
- Comparison and logical operators
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`, `match-case`)
- Loops (`while`, `for`) and control flow (`break`, `continue`, `pass`)
- Functions and argument passing

## Project Features

- Two game modes: Player vs Player and Player vs Bot
- Instructional help with visual layout of the board
- Clean terminal-based UI with responsive feedback
- Input error handling and occupied-block checking
- Win, loss, and draw recognition
- Option to replay after each match

## Note

To play this game, simply run the script in your terminal and follow the on-screen instructions. No additional packages are required.

This project reflects my current understanding of Python fundamentals. It was built as a hands-on way to practice logic, functions, and control structures while creating a fun and interactive command-line application.
