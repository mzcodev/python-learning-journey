# Tic Tac Toe - Terminal Game

This is an enhanced text-based Tic Tac Toe game built in Python. The game allows the user to play against another player or a computer bot. It runs entirely in the terminal and provides a structured and interactive experience. The objective is to get three of your marks (X or O) in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally — before your opponent does.

## Concepts Used

This project uses the following Python concepts:

- Introduction and setup of Python and development environments  
- Data types and variables (strings, lists, sets, tuples)  
- String operations and formatting  
- Comparison and logical operators  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- Loops (`while`, `for`) and control flow (`break`, `continue`)  
- Functions and argument passing  
- Use of built-in modules like `os` and `random`  
- Game state management using global variables  

## Project Features

- Two game modes: Player vs Player and Player vs Bot  
- Smart bot that blocks and wins using simple logic  
- Randomized first player each round  
- Sign conflict resolution and automatic assignment  
- Clear board layout and instructions displayed in terminal  
- Input validation and used-block checking  
- Clean terminal UI using `os.system('cls'/'clear')`  
- Win, loss, and draw detection  
- Option to replay without restarting the script  

## How to Play

1. Run the script using Python 3 in your terminal:  
   `python tic_tac_toe.py`  
2. Choose whether to play against a friend or the bot  
3. Select your sign (X or O)  
4. Enter a number (1–9) to place your mark in the corresponding block

## Note

No additional packages are required. The game is built entirely using core Python libraries and logic.

This project reflects an improved understanding of Python fundamentals, and was built as a practical way to develop better structure, logic handling, and interactivity in a command-line application.
