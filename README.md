## ðŸŽ¯ Repository Goal

This repository serves as my personal journal to document projects and exercises I create along my Python learning journey.

Here, you will find small programs and various practice projects written progressively as I advance through my course.  
My goal is to deepen my understanding of programming concepts and steadily develop my skills by building real-world applications step by step.

This repository will be continuously updated with new projects to make my learning path more complete and engaging. ðŸš€
