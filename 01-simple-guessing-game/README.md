# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game where the program selects a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it within 10 attempts. The game provides feedback such as "Warm", "Cold", "Warmer", and "Colder" to help the player get closer to the correct number.

## Concepts Used

This project was built using only basic Python concepts learned from an introductory course, including:

- Getting started with Python and understanding data types (numbers, strings, lists, etc.)
- Working with comparison and logical operators
- Using conditional statements
- Using loops
- Handling user input and output

## How to Run

1. Run the code in your Python environment.
2. At the start, type "help" to see the game instructions.
3. Type "start" to begin the game.
4. Enter numbers between 1 and 100 to guess the secret number.
